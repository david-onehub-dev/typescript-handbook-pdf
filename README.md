# TypeScript-Handbook (3.7)

The PDF is generated by gitbook. The document is based on [Typescript handlebook](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook)

For a more formal description of the language, see the [latest TypeScript Language Specification](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md).

**Note**
it seems that gitbook does not like "docs" folder
