# TypeScript-Handbook (4.1)

The PDF is generated by gitbook. The document is based on [Typescript handlebook](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website.git)

For a more formal description of the language, see the [latest TypeScript Language Specification](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tree/master/doc).

**Note**
it seems that gitbook does not like "docs" folder
